Cat Classifier is a web application that helps people identify cat breeds. It uses <a href='https://keras.io/api/applications/resnet/#resnet152v2-function'>ResNet152V2</a> provided by Keras to create the CNN model and uses over 20,000 photos of cats selected from the <a href='https://www.kaggle.com/ma7555/cat-breeds-dataset'>Cat Breeds Dataset</a> to train this model. Now it can classify 13 types of cats as well as the mixed breed.
